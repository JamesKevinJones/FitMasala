# ADR Format

> FitMasala adaptation: this repo keeps its decision log in one append-only file, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, not in numbered files under `docs/adr/`. "ADR" in these skills means an entry in that file.

ADRs are appended to the end of `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Never rewrite or renumber existing entries; a decision that changes gets a new, later entry that says what it supersedes.

## Template

Match the existing entries exactly:

```md
## {YYYY-MM-DD} — {Short title of the decision}

**Decision:** {One or two sentences: what we decided.}

**Why:** {The context and the reason, including the alternative that was rejected when that rejection is non-obvious.}

---
```

That's it. An entry can be a few lines. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why*, not in filling out sections.

## Superseding

When an entry reverses an earlier one, name it in the **Why:** ("Replaces the 2026-08-19 entry 'Neo-brutalism theme' because…"). Leave the earlier entry in place.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it: you'll just reverse it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library: just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite. These stop the next engineer from "fixing" something that was deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it; otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.
